# GIS_Topological_Editing_Merging

This work is realized on QGIS.

The aim of this study is to merge features from adjacent raster images of beytepe. Firstly, we digitize our features. Slected part of the driveway and some buildings. Tse objects were drawn manually. Some topological errors were encountered due to images from two different sources. These errors were fixed using the Snap tool. The related layers are combined with the vector layer merging function.
